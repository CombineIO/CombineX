> Customize handling of asynchronous events by combining event-processing operators. -- Apple

`Combine` is a [Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) framework launched by Apple at WWDC 2019. It will definitely be the cornerstone of Swift programming in the foreseeable future.
